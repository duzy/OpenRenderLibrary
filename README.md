# Open Render Library

Open Render Library is designed to render 3D models created by modeling tools. It's backing on GPU
interfaced using OpenGL ES 2.0/3.0 (or possibly OpenGL 4.0).

The current version is *0.00*.

    At this *0.00* version, the objects are not fully rendered. But it could be a nice tool for
    practicing Shader Language in different version. The OpenGL changed a lot since 1.1, the
    latest version of the Shader Language seems new to me. I'm using this *ORL 0.00* to
    practice my 3D modeling and rendering skills in Shader Language. It's not easy to find updated
    tutorials and materials from online, most of the tutorials and articles are *outdated* (talking about
    1.1, 2.0), and the shading language they used varies in different versions, which making you much
    harder to step on the right path and spend much more time to practice.
